Vamsi Kurama started the sessions with an impressive explanation on basics.</p>

<p>After those fundamentals he focussed on object oriented python with real time scenarios.
He also gave a brief explanation on an very intresting topic Flask - the web framework. Some of the SRKIT students were even assigned some projects on flask.</p>
